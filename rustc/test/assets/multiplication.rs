// Test: Operator precedence with multiplication
// This test verifies that the compiler correctly handles operator precedence
// between addition and multiplication
// Expected return value: 7
//
// This file is not compatible with Rust because:
// 1. Arithmetic expressions cannot be used as standalone expressions
// 2. The return type of main() is not specified (should be () or Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>)
fn main() {
    1 + 2 * 3;
