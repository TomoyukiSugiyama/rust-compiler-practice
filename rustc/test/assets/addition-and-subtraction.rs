// Test: Combined addition and subtraction operations
// This test verifies that the compiler can handle multiple arithmetic operations
// in a single expression
// Expected return value: 48
//
// This file is not compatible with Rust because:
// 1. Arithmetic expressions cannot be used as standalone expressions
// 2. The return type of main() is not specified (should be () or Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>)
